# Covid-19-Severity-Detection-Project
University Major Project

This project aims to develop a COVID-19 severity detection system using machine learning techniques. The severity of COVID-19 can vary significantly among individuals, with some experiencing mild symptoms while others require intensive care. Early identification of individuals with severe cases is crucial for efficient allocation of healthcare resources and timely intervention.

The project leverages a dataset of COVID-19 patient records, including demographic information, medical history, and test results. Machine learning algorithms are trained on this dataset to classify patients into different severity levels, such as mild, moderate, or severe. By analyzing a patient's data, the system can provide an assessment of the severity of their COVID-19 infection.

Key Features:
- Data preprocessing: The project involves cleaning and preprocessing the raw patient data to ensure accurate and reliable predictions.
- Feature selection: Relevant features are identified and selected to build an effective severity detection model.
- Machine learning model training: Various machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees, random forests, or support vector machines, are employed to train the severity detection model.
- Performance evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using appropriate metrics to assess its accuracy and performance in detecting COVID-19 severity levels.
- Deployment: The model can be deployed as a web or mobile application, allowing healthcare professionals to input patient data and obtain severity predictions in real-time.

Contributions and collaboration are welcome to enhance the accuracy and generalizability of the COVID-19 severity detection system. By accurately identifying the severity of COVID-19 cases, this project aims to assist healthcare providers in efficiently managing resources and providing timely care to those who need it the most.
